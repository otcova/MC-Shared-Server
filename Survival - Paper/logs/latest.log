[17:27:56] [Server thread/WARN]: The server will make no attempt to authenticate usernames. Beware.
[17:27:56] [Server thread/WARN]: While this makes the game possible to play without internet access, it also opens up the ability for hackers to connect with any username they choose.
[17:27:56] [Server thread/WARN]: To change this, set "online-mode" to "true" in the server.properties file.
